Create a beauty tutorial video demonstrating ombré gradient lips technique. 
Close-up shot of lips, frontal view with slight angle. Show hands applying 
dark berry lip liner to outer edges of lips, then lighter pink/nude shade to 
center. Use lip brush to blend the colors seamlessly where they meet, creating 
smooth gradient effect from dark outer edges to light center. Show finger 
gently tapping/patting to blend. Include lip products (liner, lipstick, gloss) 
in frame. Good lighting highlighting lip texture and shine. Add final layer 
of clear gloss to center for dimension. Professional manicure, clean aesthetic. 
Vertical 9:16 format for social media. Smooth, satisfying blending motions. 
Duration: 90 seconds with clear step progression.
